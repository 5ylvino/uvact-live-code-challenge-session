CODING CHALLENGE FOR STAGE 2 – LIVE INTERVIEW SESSION 

QUESTIONS: 

1). Given a function, that takes the str parameter being passed and return 1 if the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. Otherwise return 0. For example: if str is "(hello (world))", then the output should be 1, but if str is "((hello (world))" the output should be 0 because the brackets do not correctly match up. Only "(" and ")" will be used as brackets. If str contains no brackets return 1.  

Where str is the parameter or input string, and are viz  

(uvact)(tech)), (v(vact)) t(ch), (uv((act)(tech)), and (uv((act))(tech))  

as test cases. 

Examples 

Input: "(coder)(byte))" 
Output: 0 

 

Input: "(c(oder)) b(yte)" 
Output: 1 

 

NOTE: This question is designed to evaluate candidate’s logic reason in programming. 

2). Design according to an OTP input form in Reactjs to look like this: 

 

Any box you click on, or your cursor is on it. It should be highlighted in green as shown. 

Following the same pattern as (a) it should do the same when deleting. 

And When OTP 6 digits are pasted, it should automatically enter in its own box position. 

Should only accept number only. 

NOTE: This question is designed to evaluate candidate’s ability to (1). follow instruction, (2). he/her knowledge in react vs hook, and (3). efficiency in designing
