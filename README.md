## CODING CHALLENGE FOR STAGE 2 â€“ LIVE INTERVIEW SESSION 

QUESTIONS: 

1).[VANILLA JAVASCRIPT] Given a function, that takes the str parameter being passed and return `1` if the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. Otherwise return `0`. For example: if str is `"(hello (world))"`, then the output should be 1, but if str is `"((hello (world))"` the output should be `0` because the brackets do not correctly match up. Only `"(" and ")"` will be used as brackets. If str contains no brackets return `1`.  

Where str is the parameter or input string, and viz  

 ```(((u(((v((ac))t)))(tech)))))```

as test cases. 

```
Examples 

Input: "(coder)(byte))" 
Output: 0 

 

Input: "(c(oder)) b(yte)" 
Output: 1
```

*Functionality of the OTP input box* \
a. Any box you click on, or your cursor is on it. It should be highlighted in green as shown. 
 
b. Following the same pattern as (a) it should do the same when deleting. 

c. And When OTP 6 digits are pasted, it should automatically enter in its own box position. 

c. Should only accept number only.  

d. Every input digit must start from first box

f. No use of external library
